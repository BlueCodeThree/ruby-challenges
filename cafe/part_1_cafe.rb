# This challenge has three parts. Use all you have learned to
# implement the solution. Use methods to keep your code DRY and
# clean. Use data structures that are appropriate.

# Part 1
# You are working at a cafe where you have a current backlog of orders:
# 6 lattes
# 2 scones
# and
# 3 teas
orders = {lattes: 6, scones: 2, teas: 3}
# Write a program that asks the customer for their order. The customer
# will only order one item.
#   if they order a latte, add one to the number of lattes you need to make,
#   if they order a scone, add one to the number of scones you need to serve,
#   if they order a tea, add one to the number of teas you need to make
puts "What would you like to order?"
puts "Press (1) for lattes"
puts "Press (2) for scones"
puts "Press (3) for tea"

new_order = gets.chomp.to_i

case new_order
when 1
    orders[:lattes] += 1
when 2
    orders[:scones] += 1
when 3
    orders[:teas] +=1
end
# Print the final order so you know what to make.
puts "To make: #{orders}"

# Part 2
# Lattes sell for $4, and cost $2 to make
# Scones sell for $5, and cost $3 to make
# Tea sells for $3, and cost $0.50 to make

# Print out the total profit for the orders you have.

# Part 3
# Write a program that asks the user for their order.
# Allow the user to input mutiple items and to specify quantities.
# When the order is complete:
#   Print the order
#   Print the total price

# Example:
# What would you like to order (latte, scone, tea)? Type (q)uit to quit.
# latte
# How many?
# 2
# Anything else? Type (q)uit to quit.
# tea
# How many?
# 1
# Anything else? Type (q)uit to quit.
# coffee
# I'm sorry, we don't serve that. Would you like latte, scone, or tea? Type (q)uit to quit.
# q
# Thank you! Your order:
# 2 latte
# 1 tea
# Order total: $11.00
